Drag and Drop:

Drag content items from the "Unscheduled Content" list directly onto any date slot in the calendar.

You can also drag content items between different date slots on the calendar to reschedule them.

To un-schedule an item, drag it from the calendar back to the "Unscheduled Content" list.

Edit Content: Click on any content item (either in the unscheduled list or on the calendar) to open the modal and edit its details.

Navigate Calendar: Use the "Prev" and "Next" buttons to move between months.

Filter by Platform: Check the boxes next to platforms in the "Filter by Platform" section to show only content related to those platforms on the calendar.

Save to JSON: Click "Save to JSON" to download your current content plan as a .json file. This allows you to back up your data.

Print Calendar: Click "Print Calendar" to get a printable version of your calendar view.

The data is automatically saved to your browser's local storage, so your content plan will persist even if you close and reopen the browser tab.
